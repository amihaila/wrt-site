### Waterloo Rocketry Team Site ###

Hey y'all!

This is the repo for the Waterloo Rocketry Team site at waterloorocketry.com.

If you're on the team and would like to contribute, message Jacob and I'll add you as a collaborator. The live site lives on the gh-pages branch. Please do not commit directly to this branch. If you want to make significant changes, please clone the repo, create your own development branch, and submit a pull request back to master when you're done working. (If all you're doing is correcting a typo or something of similar scale, feel free to correct it directly in master.) Also feel free to use the issues feature - it's an easy way to keep track of everything that needs to be changed without digging through team slack message history.

I think that's all. Message me if you have any questions/concerns/problems/etc.

Happy web devving ;)
